Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Required Software:
1. Python/Numpy/Scipy (only tested with Python 2.7.1)
2. Ctypes
3. NFFT3
4. Qhull (for calculating sampling density)
5. Matplotlib (required to view the images at the end of the example script!)

Note on Ctypes: I included 2 files (nfft3.py and fftw3.py) which were generated with ctypesgen. These files are essentially wrappers of nfft3.h and fftw3.h for ctypes. I think unless the *.h files change significantly, just using these should be fine, but I recommend updating them with ctypesgen if nfft or fftw are updated.


Getting Started
---------------
You can cd to python-nfft and run python nfft_example.py. You will see it working, and then the result images appear. To look at the code, just open nfft_example.py in your favorite viewer and take a look at how it works.
