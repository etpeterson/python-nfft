Python-NFFT: A Python wrapper for NFFT3

Overview
--------
This functions primarily as a wrapper for NFFT3, so please see their website at (http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/nfft/index.php) for questions relating to the NFFT.

NOTE: Because my goal was creating something that works, not everything is easy or intuitive to use. Not all the functions may be bug free, but the standard nfft should work fine (see the example). It also still has a lot of commented blocks and is not very clean. Sorry! It works for my purposes, but it may not work how you want it, so some programming may be required!

VERSION NOTE: I have only tested it with NFFT-3.1.3, it may or may not work with other versions!

My goal was to create an interface for NFFT3 in Python for MRI, so some of the language and functions may be MRI specific. Please let me know if you have suggestions or comments.
